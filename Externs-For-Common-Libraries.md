# A place to record externs for common libraries

# Introduction

If you know of a public externs file for a library you use not listed here, please go ahead and add it.

A variety of API are supported here:
https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/tree/master/contrib/externs

If you don't see the externs here, be sure to start with the FAQ:
[How do I write an extern file](FAQ#how-do-i-write-an-externs-file)

# Extern generation utilities

- To generate externs from a IDL file see this project: https://code.google.com/archive/p/closureidl
- To auto-generate externs from a library try: http://blog.dotnetwise.com/2009/11/closure-compiler-externs-extractor.html
- To auto-generate externs for Polymer elements try: https://github.com/PolymerLabs/extern-generator

**NOTE THAT MILEAGE MAY VARY WITH THESE TOOLS AND AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED EXTERNS MAY NOT BE A FUNCTIONAL SUBSTITUTE FOR CORRECT HAND WRITTEN ONES**
