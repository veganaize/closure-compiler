**RefasterJS is no longer supported.**

See https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/3702 for details

RefasterJS was a tool for refactoring JavaScript that leverages the Closure Compiler's AST and type information to make refactoring easier. Developers write a JavaScript template to tell the tool what code to change and how it should be changed.
